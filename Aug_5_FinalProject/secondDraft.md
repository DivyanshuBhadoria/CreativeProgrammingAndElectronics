My project is to make a game where the player controls a tree that slowly grows. 

There will be birds falling down and the player has to make sure to catch them.

When the player catches the bird, a basket will appear on the tree. I will need

light sensor and potentiometer as inputs from the arduino. The light sensor will

control the speed of the growth while the potentiometer will control the angle of

growth.
