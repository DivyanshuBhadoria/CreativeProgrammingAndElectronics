My plan is to make a game incorporating both Arduino and Processing using trees and birds. The

goal of the game is to catch the birds that are falling. As the birds hit your branch they will poof 

into a nest. The arduino will have a light sensor and potentiometer. The light sensor controls the 

treeâ€™s speed growth and game lighting, while the potentiometer controls the angle of growth. The 

sounds will play using the piezo buzzer attached to the arduino. I am still thinking about other 

elements that I can add like the tree branching, etc.
